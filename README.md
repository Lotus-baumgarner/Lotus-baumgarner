## 👋 Hello, I'm Lotus! Welcome to My GitHub! 👋  
*"Everyone's perception of reality is an illusion."*  

### About Me:  
👩‍💻 After dedicating 10 years to raising my family as a stay-at-home parent, I made the exciting decision to pursue my passion for technology. With a strong affinity for math and science, I discovered that data analytics perfectly combines these interests with my love for problem-solving and discovery. 👩‍💻  

🎓 I hold a **Data Science Live Certificate** from Flatiron School and am on track to graduate with a **Bachelor’s in Data Science** from Colorado Technical University in **March 2026**. 🎓  

🌟 I am actively seeking opportunities to launch my career as a **Data Analyst**, with a particular interest in the **healthcare** and **gaming** industries. I am eager to apply my skills to solve complex problems, uncover meaningful insights, and contribute to impactful projects. 🌟  

### Personal Highlights:  
🏡 My husband and I have been happily married for 13 years, and we are proud parents of three wonderful children—two daughters (ages 12 and 8) and a son (age 2). 🏡
